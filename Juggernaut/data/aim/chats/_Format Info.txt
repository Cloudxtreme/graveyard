Format Information for Bot Chat Settings (AIM):

The first line of the bot's chat file will be a single number (either 0
or 1). If 0, the bot will be able to be invited to any room. If 1, the bot
may only be invited to the rooms listed below (see below for information
on how rooms are set up).

Chat rooms are always started after the first line. The first line is
supposed to be for the bot's "allowability" to join any room. If the first
line is not a 0 or 1 value, you will be alerted when your bot connects.

The chat rooms are formatted as follows:
	Room Name===auto join (0|1)===able to be removed (0|1)

Room Name = The name of the chatroom
Auto Join = Binary value:
	1 = The bot will automatically join the room on connection.
	0 = The bot will not automatically join.
Able to be removed = If the bot can be commanded to leave by anybody.
	1 = Only an Admin may send the bot away.
	0 = Anybody can send the bot away.

	### Example: ###
Chaos AI Technology===1===1
Bot Chat===0===1

If you set 0 for both auto-join and able to be removed, then you really
don't need to include that in your list (unless you have it set to not
allow unspecified chat invitations).
