Aiden Change Log
================

Version 1.0
	-- Converted brain from Alpha to RiveScript.
	-- Substitutions and message formatting removed; left up to RiveScript.
	-- Many other changes... Aiden has gone closed-source for months and months since
		the 0.2 release.

Version 0.2
	-- Added client variables for use with Perl-savvy Alpha replies:
		omsg => Client's actual full message they sent to the bot (sentences and all).
		cmsg => Current sentence being fed to Alpha (before formatting).
		dosentence => If 1, Aiden will continue getting replies per-sentence. Set to 0
			to cancel the rest of the sentence-loop.

		$aiden->{clients}->{$client}->{dosentence} etc...
	-- Added variables that replies can use:
		$day   => Current day 'Monday'
		$month => Current month 'October'
		$mnum  => Day of the month '21'
		$year  => Current year '2005'
	-- Added "commands" folder. This is for putting the subroutines of your more
		complex objects.
