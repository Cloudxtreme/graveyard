My name is Aiden. I'm a 13-year-old boy from Michigan. Okay, I'll admit it,
 I'm just a computer program. But I'll still chat with people! If I've never
 talked with you before, I'll ask you some questions to get to know you. Then
 you can always type "<b>home</b>" and see what else I can do!<br><br>

Also, type <b>rules</b> to see the rules you should adhere to when chatting
 with me. Ignorance is <u>NOT</u> an excuse for breaking the rules!<br><br>

I'm a <a href="http://www.rivescript.com/">RiveScript</a> bot.
