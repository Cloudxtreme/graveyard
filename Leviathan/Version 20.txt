AiChaos Leviathan Version 2.0
=============================

FIRST THINGS FIRST: The Moderators and Administrators list currently
	matches that of the last state of our bots. Edit these!!!
	The Botmasters list though has been dimmed down as has been
	the case in older Leviathan versions.

This version was never released on AiChaos prior to April 10, 2006.
This is the version of Leviathan that AiChaos's own bots ran off of.
Somewhere between the 1.5.1 patch release and now, the Leviathan
project was abandoned for the Aiden project, and this version was
never released.

It has been a long time since I've worked on this version of Leviathan,
so at this time I cannot provide a Change Log for this version. I know
it has some changes above version 1.5.1, but I wouldn't be able to tell
you what these changes are.

NOTE: The Graphical User Interface for this version is NOT included.
I personally did not use the GUI when running my bots because there were
several bots running and the GUI is more likely to freeze up in this case.
Either that or I broke something and couldn't fix it. I don't remember
exactly, but the GUI is nowhere to be found for Version 2.0. I can't
guarantee the one from 1.5.x will work with it either.

Included in this release, though, are some "hidden files" that I had
personal use for but never included in the public releases. I'll outline
what these files are and exactly what their purposes were here:
_____________________________________

BRAIN: Guardians

	This was a never-released brain made specifically for the
	CKS Guardians bots. These bots were to be employed for our
	own monitoring purposes, for instance to keep an eye on a bot
	whom we think is using plagiarized AiChaos software.

	While the Guardian bots were going to do a lot more, currently
	the brain only has four functions:

		- Add a human to "Watch Humans" group on Buddylist.
		- Remove humans from that group.
		- Add a bot to the "Watch Bots" group.
		- Remove bots from that group.

	Upon initialization, the brain would begin a queued loop of
	calling &guardians_active every 10 seconds. This subroutine was
	to be used for doing things unprovoked, like querying things on
	its own without being commanded to do so. This subroutine was
	never put to good use.

	Another subroutine in the brain, &guardian_botchat, was to handle
	a controlled conversation between the Guardian and another AIM
	bot, which would likely be one suspected for plagiarism.

	Upon receiving a message, the brain would return <noreply> unless
	the user was on the "data/authority/aichaos.txt" list (being an
	AiChaos Administrator). This list is used nowhere else in Leviathan.

HIDDEN COMMAND: ./commands/_hidden/probe.pl

	Name:        !probe
	Description: Probe a Bot
	Usage:       !probe <bot username>

	When issued this command, the bot would set up topics for the user
	in question to direct them to this same command. The bot would ask
	the suspect a few "questions" and see how it replied. For instance,
	it would send the suspect the "!juggernaut" command to see if the
	bot returned Juggernaut's proper copyright details.

	Upon completion of the interview, it would return to the one who
	called this command how the other bot responded and whether or not
	you should be worried about it. It would then block the bot temporarily
	to prevent the bot from continuing to chat with your Leviathan,
	because bots don't accomplish anything by chatting with one another.

HIDDEN COMMAND: ./commands/_hidden/valentine.pl

	Name:        !valentine
	Description: Happy Valentine's Day!
	Usage:       !valentine

	This was just an easter egg command. It returns a heart made out
	of # signs.

DATA FOLDERS:

	All the files (buddylists, profiles, welcome messages, etc.) for
	each of the original AiChaos bots are included. You can even find
	CksGuardians' profile here, although it's not much to look at.

	The authority folder's moderators and admins list has been left
	completely untouched from our AiChaos bots. You'll probably want to
	edit these!

	The botmasters list has been dimmed down to the same old "example
	example etc. etc." stuff from past releases.

	The Blacklist and Warners List from the AiChaos bots is also included.

LOCAL LIBRARY:

	The current state of Net::YIM, as well as Matt Austin's abandoned YahooSimple
	project, has revealed some kind of error with the connection: if a Yahoo
	bot runs all by itself (no other bots running to slow it down), it connects
	and operates just fine. Else, it won't sign on.

	Don't bother myself or Matt Austin with errors with the Yahoo connection.
	I'm not the genius behind the connection, and Matt Austin abandoned the
	project and probably won't help you.

	If you really need a Yahoo bot, use something other than Perl. ;)

ALPHA BRAINS:

	In addition to the "Alice, Eliza, and Standard" Chatbot::Alpha bot brains,
	this release also includes the brains from the AiChaos bots: Casey, Cody,
	and Chaos.
