<b class="header">:: Setup Authorities</b><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Before ever starting your bot up, it is <b>HIGHLY</b> recommended that you set
up some authority users (specifically, the botmasters). Botmasters have access to very
powerful commands that could harm your computer if they fall into the wrong hands. You
must edit the botmasters list FIRST before signing your bots on!<p>

<b class="header">:: Quick Overview: Client Format</b>
<blockquote>
	On Leviathan, "clients" (names the bot uses to identify its users), goes in the
	format of <i>SENDER-username</i>. "SENDER" would be the messenger or medium
	(the "sender") that the user is talking to the bot on. It should be all uppercase,
	no punctuation. The "username" is their actual username.<p>

	Examples of clients:<br>
	<b>MSN Users:</b><br>
	MSN-name@domain.com<br>
	MSN-me@passport.net<br>
	<b>AIM Users:</b><br>
	AIM-myscreenname<br>
	AIM-anothersn<br>
	<b>Jabber Users:</b><br>
	JABBER-myname@jabber.com<br>
	JABBER-myname@jabber.org<p>

	You can get the idea now. When you edit your authority lists, the usernames must
	be formatted like that. Now, you can continue.
</blockquote><p>

<b class="header">:: Botmasters List</b>
<blockquote>
	<b>File Path:</b> Leviathan/data/authority/master.txt<br>
	<b>Description:</b> You. The bot's owner. This position should be used for nobody else.<p>

	This is probably the first file you'll want to edit (and are highly encouraged too).<p>

	Following the client format (above), enter <u>YOUR OWN</u> usernames into this list.
	The Master power is very dangerous in the wrong hands!
</blockquote><p>

<b class="header">:: Administrators List</b>
<blockquote>
	<b>File Path:</b> Leviathan/data/authority/administrators.txt<br>
	<b>Description:</b> Your bot's keepers. Administrators control a lot of your bot, but
	their powers are limited. They also have access to some commands that can <i>potentially</i>
	be very annoying to your bot's users. That's why only trusted users should be Admins.<p>

	You don't need to edit the admins list at this time, although it wouldn't hurt.
</blockquote><p>

<b class="header">:: Moderators List</b>
<blockquote>
	<b>File Path:</b> Leviathan/data/authority/moderators.txt<br>
	<b>Description:</b> Moderators have very basic bot upkeeping commands. For example, blocking
	and unblocking users. This is about the extent of the moderator's power.

	You don't need to edit the mods list at this time, although it wouldn't hurt.
