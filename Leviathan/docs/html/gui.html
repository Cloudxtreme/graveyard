<b class="header">:: Graphical User Interface (GUI)</b><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	First of all, the GUI was created merely as an alternative means of running your bots. It's not
necessarily superior or inferior to the DOS interface, however under certain circumstances one may rise
above the other.<p>

<b class="header">:: When to use the GUI?</b><br>
<blockquote>
	If you are just starting with Leviathan, it is <b>highly</b> recommended that you use the DOS
	version first. This is to make sure Leviathan will even cooperate on your computer. Once you are able
	to sign on your bots with the DOS interface, then you can consider moving to the GUI.<p>

	<b>GUI is best for:</b> If you are only running one or two bots, the GUI will work the best.
	However, if you're running lots and lots of bots (maybe 6+, or 3+ on AIM), then the DOS interface
	is definitely the best way to go. The GUI will run slowly if many many bots are connected to it
	at once.<p>

	<b>GUI is NOT best for:</b> Running lots of bots. Also, the GUI will naturally run a little slower
	because it not only has to keep up with your bots, but it has to keep updating itself as well. If
	you're running your bots as 24/7 services, I would recommend the DOS version.
