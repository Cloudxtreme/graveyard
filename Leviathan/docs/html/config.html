<b class="header">:: Bot Configuration</b><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The first thing you'll probably need to do is configure your bot. By "configure," I
don't necessarily mean "putting in your bot's log-on information." That part comes later.<p>

<b class="header">:: Main Configuration File</b><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The main configuration file in AiChaos Leviathan is found in "config/settings.cfg" -
edit this file with a text editor such as Notepad to configure it.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<b>Note:</b> This configuration file <i>is</i> Perl code, so you need at least
a <i>little</i> bit of knowledge. Here are some little tips, for if you have no experience
with Perl codes:<p>

<ul>
	<li>A line beginning with the pound sign <b>#</b> are comments. The config file is
		full of comments to explain what to do. You shouldn't need to touch, edit,
		or add comments here.</li>
	<li>Setting a variable goes in the format <b>$variable = 'value';</b> - that's
		exactly how they're formatted here.</li>
	<li>All command lines (lines that don't begin with a <b>#</b>) must END with a
		semicolon <b>;</b></li>
	<li>The value for a variable can be in "quotes", OR 'apostrophes'. The default
		settings all use apostrophes, because they're simpler. If the value you
		want to insert contains an apostrophe itself, put a backslash <b>\</b>
		before it. Example:<p>

		# Default sender of e-mails.<br>
		$chaos->{config}->{email}->{from} = 'Dave<font color="#0000FF">\'</font>s Bot &lt;bot@davesite.com&gt;';</li>
	<li>Variables with number values do not need quotes or apostrophes, nor should
		they. Putting quotes or apostrophes around a number may cause problems
		later in the bot.</li>
</ul>
