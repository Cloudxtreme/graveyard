<b class="header">:: Change Log</b><p>

<b><font color="#FF0000">Version 1.5.1 Patch</font></b><br>
<ul>
	<li><b>Bot Connection Mechanism</b> patched: uses pure Perl instead of XML to define connections.</li>
</ul>

<b><font color="#FF0000">Version 1.5</font></b><br>
<ul>
	<li><b>Message Queues</b> inverted. Code is executed <i>before</i> the time is spent. The time now is used as a
		"cool down" limit. In this manner, AIM bots will respond more quickly depending on how busy they are.</li>
	<li><b>GUI</b> has been reprogrammed.</li>
</ul>

<b><font color="#FF0000">Version 1.4</font></b><br>
<ul>
	<li><b>GUI Temporarily Suspended:</b> Due to drastic changes in Leviathan.pl, the GUI hasn't been updated
		and is therefore suspended (however, the source "GUI.txt" is included if you want to edit it yourself).</li>
	<li><b>Bot Settings Change:</b> Instead of files in the "bots" folder, you now define all your bots in
		"config/connections.xml" - the downside is that you have to use XML instead of plain text.
		However, now it's easier to add mirrors. If you have 5 AIM bots that use the same reply data,
		and then decide to change their brain, you just have to make one change. Also, you can turn
		individual mirrors on or off (or turn the entire bot on or off).</li>
	<li><b>Timestamps Subroutine Update:</b> Time::Format is now being used, so strings such as "Weekday,
		Month d yyyy @ H:mm:ss A.M." will work. However, for backwards compatibility the old tags will
		still work as well (however, &lt;day_year&gt; has been removed).</li>
	<li><b>Games Broadcast Handler Update:</b> Now supports Yahoo, IRC, and Jabber users to participate in
		multiplayer games.</li>
	<li><b>Yahoo Messenger</b> listener added (still in beta; may not sign on if many other bots are also
		connected).</li>
	<li><b>Games::Manager renamed to Games::Multiplayer::Manager</b> by request of CPAN admins (also:
		<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~kirsle/Games-Multiplayer-Manager-1.00/lib/Games/Multiplayer/Manager.pm" target="_blank">CPAN
		Documentation on Games::Multiplayer::Manager</a>)</li>
</ul>

<b><font color="#FF0000">Version 1.3</font></b><br>
<ul>
	<li><b>Graphical User Interface</b> added.</li>
	<li><b>Eliza Brain Update:</b> New Eliza objects are created for each user of an Eliza bot, so when
		Eliza tries to bring up something from past conversation, it won't mix up users (even though
		that can be quite humorous).</li>
	<li><b>User Profile Update:</b> User profiles now only contain the required data initially (stars, points,
		temporary blocks, etc.) However, &profile_send will add new variables to a profile as it needs them,
		giving you unlimited range of variables. (Run "util/Levi1.2 Profile Updater.pl" to update user profiles
		from older versions of Leviathan).</li>
	<li><b>Alpha Brain Updates:</b> The Alpha brain (Chatbot::Alpha 1.32) now has support for topics, as well
		as many bug fixes (i.e. ways to break out of infinite loops or recursion errors).</li>
	<li><b>Command Update:</b> Commands marked as "Hidden" will not only be excluded from the menu, but the "usage"
		command will pretend as if the command doesn't exist.</li>
	<li><b>Documentation:</b> Links for registering new usernames for the messengers have been added to the "Setup Bots"
		page in the documentation.</li>
</ul>

<b><font color="#FF0000">Version 1.2</font></b><br>
<ul>
	<li><b>Added Listeners:</b> TOC and SMTP. TOC is an AIM listener that uses Net::AIM (some people had
		problems with Net::OSCAR). The SMTP listener will enable you to set up e-mail auto-responders.</li>
	<li><b>Reply Sentence-Splitting:</b> The bots will now split up your sentences and give you a paragraph
		of replies in return (i.e. "Hello. What's up?" --&gt; "Hey! Not much, you?").</li>
	<li><b>HTTP "Files":</b> A few special "files" on the HTTP listener have been added:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Accessing <b>/blocked.cgi?user=<font color="#0000FF">SENDER-username</font></b> will return
		whether or not they are blocked (in <b>&lt;blocked&gt;:&lt;why&gt;</b> format).</li>
		<li>Accessing <b>/warner.cgi?user=<font color="#0000FF">SENDER-username</font></b> will return
		whether or not they're on the Warners List.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>HTTP Dynamic Pages</b> don't write temporary files anymore; the updated page codes are sent without
		actually sending files.</li>
	<li><b>Commands Added:</b><br>
		!warnlist - Administrator Only - Modify the warners list<br>
		!warn - Botmaster Only - Issue an AIM warning</li>
</ul>

<b><font color="#FF0000">Version 1.1</font></b><br>
<ul>
	<li><b>Messenger capability is now less strict.</b> The bot won't <i>require</i> messenger modules that
		aren't going to be needed.</li>
	<li><b>MSN ClientCaps</b> are now fixed.</li>
	<li><b>Command indexing</b> now prints a notification for each command indexed (much like it does for
		including subroutines and handlers).</li>
	<li><b>Menu command update:</b> The menu sorts categories more efficiently, so if you have 10 or more
		categories they will remain in numerical, not ASCII, order.</li>
	<li><b>Reload command update:</b> The !reload command now reloads startup configuration and substitution
		data.</li>
	<li><b>Bot fonts</b> will now revert to defaults if the font could not be found (don't need to worry
		about itty bitty fonts on AIM anymore!)</li>
	<li><b>Timestamp</b> bugs fixed (a request for &lt;month_num&gt; will return from 1 to 12, not 0 to 11).</li> 
	<li><b>Including module Games::Manager</b> for multiplayer games ($chaos->{games} holds the object).</li>
	<li><b>Bug fix in AIM Chatrooms' timestamps</b> (&lt;mins&gt; now filters in correctly).</li>
	<li><b>Minor bug fixes</b> in the handler files.</li>
	<li><b>Documentation</b> - "low-fi.html" is now even "lower-fi" - consists only of navigation and content frames.</li>
</ul><p>

<b><font color="#FF0000">Version 1.0 -- Initial Release</font></b><br>
<ul>
	<li><i>AiChaos Leviathan was created as an improved replacement to CKS Juggernaut. These
		changes are mentioning the major differences between Juggernaut and Leviathan.</i></li>
	<li><b>Bot data update</b>: using "Client:" to identify the messenger no longer works, using
		"Listener:" is now used to define the messenger.</li>
	<li><b>Client format update</b>: The $listener has been dropped, and $client now is formatted
		as "SENDER-username" (i.e. MSN-name@domain.com, or AIM-screenname).</li>
	<li><b>User data update</b>: A few new keys have been introduced, including those used for
		temporary block systems. Also, there are 20 Custom Keys that you can use in
		commands, etc. for keeping your own types of data.</li>
	<li><b>The Jabber listener</b> has been introduced.</li>
	<li><b>Message queueing</b> now is per username, instead of having one global queue.</li>
	<li><b>Alpha brain</b> added.</li>
	<li><b>Brains update</b>: instead of having "&lt;brain&gt;_get" and "&lt;brain&gt;_load" files and
		subs, they are included in a single file. The returning hashref defines what the
		names of the subs are, so the bot can load them.</li>
	<li><b><u>Every</u> included file returns information</b> about itself in a hashref, not just commands.</li>
	<li><b>Commands</b> - The !menu command is more dynamic; adding a category is as simple as creating
		a command that ties to that category. The !menu command generates the category list dynamically.</li>
	<li><b>Main configuration</b> file is now in Perl form, allowing you to set any variable and not being limited
		to the ones Juggernaut gives you.</li>
	<li><b>New Blocking Method</b>: Anytime the bot has to block somebody by itself, it uses temporary
		blocks. The block equation is <font face="Courier New" size="2">(number of times blocked)<sup>2</sup> * 15
		minutes</font>.</li>
	<li><b>BlackList Update</b>: The !blacklist command now takes a <u>reason</u> the user was banned; this
		reason is saved in the blacklist and returned to that user when they start a conversation (MSN).</li>
	<li><b>Conversation Logs Update</b>: Collective conversation logs are now kept in "logs/chat", and the
		top-level "logs" folder is used for smaller logs (i.e. alerts, warnings, etc.)</li>
	<li>The $chaos hashref has been reorganized. Details:<p>
		<b>Added Top-Level Keys:</b><br>
		$chaos->{version} - Current program version number.<br>
		$chaos->{author} - Program's author.<br>
		$chaos->{debug} - Debug Mode On/Off.<p>

		<b>Renamed/Moved Keys:</b><br>
		$chaos->{_system} has been renamed to $chaos->{system}<br>
		$chaos->{_users} has been renamed to $chaos->{clients}<br>
		$chaos->{_data} has been renamed to $chaos->{data}<br>
		Configuration data has been moved from $chaos->{_system}->{config} to $chaos->{config}<br>
		Bot data has been moved from top-level keys into the $chaos->{bots} key.</li>
</ul>
