<b class="header">:: Subroutines</b><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Here is some basic information about subroutines.<p>

<b class="header">:: Filenames of Subroutines</b>
<blockquote>
	All subroutines should go in the "subroutines" folder; the file names aren't
	important, but as a general rule they should follow the same name as the sub
	itself (just like commands do).
</blockquote>

<b class="header">:: Format of a Subroutine</b>
<blockquote>
	Subroutine format is pretty much open-ended; you have one subroutine, that can
	receive or return any variables you need it to. The subroutine also returns
	a set of keys in a hashref explaining itself. View the sources of some subroutines
	to see how they're formatted.
