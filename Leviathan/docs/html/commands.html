<b class="header">:: Commands</b><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	This page will give you some basic information about commands, including
how they're formatted, what they receive, what they return, etc.<p>

<b class="header">:: Naming Your Commands</b><p>
<blockquote>
	Command names should be kept simple: lower-case, no spaces, and minimal
	punctuation (the underscore is acceptible). Commands can NOT begin with
	a number.<p>

	A command's file name and subroutine name must match. For example, the
	"!google" command for Google searches, its filename is "google.pl" and
	its subroutine is "sub google {" - or, for "!about", the filename is
	"about.pl" and the subroutine is "sub about {"<p>

	The way you name the commands is <u>VERY IMPORTANT</u>. For details:
	<ul>
		<li>The bot indexes the command by its file name (minus the .pl) - for example,
			it takes "google.pl" and knows that there is a command called "google"</li>
		<li>The bot calls subroutines named after the commands. For example, if it knows
			"google" is a command, it will call subroutine "&google" to get a reply.</li>
	</ul>
	So if the names don't all match, it will cause problems.

<b class="header">:: How a Good Command is Formatted</b><p>
<blockquote>
	Here is an example of how a good command should be formatted:<p>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# Must be an admin.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "This command may only be used by Administrators and higher!" unless &isAdmin($client);<p>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# Get the messenger.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my ($sender,$nick) = split(/\-/, $client, 2);<p>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# MSN only.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "This command is only for MSN." unless $sender eq 'MSN';<p>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my $convo = $msn->getConvo ($id);<br>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restrict    => 'Administrators',<br>

	<b>1) Commented Header</b><br>
	This part is NOT required, but is useful for seeing what a command does without having
	to scroll to the bottom.<p>

	<b>2) Subroutine Declaration</b><br>
	As stated above, it's required to have a subroutine named after the command.<p>

	<b>3) Receive variables for use in the command.</b><br>
	Variables received by commands are $self, $client, and $msg - see below for details.<p>

	<b>4) Return a reply.</b><br>
	The reply to be returned. See below for details.<p>

	<b>5) Returned footer.</b><br>
	The footer that the command returns. See below for details.
</blockquote><p>

<b class="header">:: Variables Received by Commands</b>
<blockquote>
	Every command receives three variables: $self, $client, and $msg. The details are as
	follows:<p>

	<b>$self</b><br>
	This is a reference to the messenger object. On MSN, this would refer to the current
	conversation (you would need to use it to find the MSN object if you needed to do a
	global function). On the other messengers, $self is the same as that messenger's object.
	See some messenger-specific command sources for examples.<p>

	<b>$client</b><br>
	This is the user's username, in the format of MESSENGER-username - as always.<p>

	<b>$msg</b><br>
	This is the message that they sent. This message is exactly how they sent it, except
	for it doesn't have HTML codes.
</blockquote><p>

<b class="header">:: Variables Returned by Commands</b>
<blockquote>
	All commands <u>MUST</u> return a $reply. Some examples of this is as follows:
	<blockquote>
		# Return a variable containing the reply.<br>
		return $reply;<p>

		# Return a string as the reply.<br>
		return "some reply";
	</blockquote><p>

	<b>*** Command Footers ***</b><br>
	As shown in the above example, commands return hashref footers with details about
	themselves. These footers are used by the !menu command to index them. Here are details:
	<blockquote>
		<b><font color="#FF0000">Required Keys</font></b><br>
		Required keys are as follows:<p>

		<b>Category => 'General',</b><br>
		This defines what category it will go into in the menu.<p>

		<b>Description => 'description on what the command does',</b><br>
		This returns a description as seen in the menu.<p>

		<b>Usage => 'how the command is used',</b><br>
		This returns how to use the command, when using the !usage command.<p>

		<b>Listener => 'AIM',</b><br>
		This is what messengers it's for. If it's only for one messenger (i.e. AIM),
		simply put that in. If it's for multiple messengers, separate by commas
		(i.e. AIM,MSN). If it doesn't matter, simply put 'All' as its value.<p>

		<b><font color="#FF0000">Optional Keys</font></b><br>
		These keys are not required, and should only be included if you plan to
		use them.<p>

		<b>Hidden => 1,</b><br>
		This will hide the command from the menu. For example, if you have two commands
		that do the same thing (maybe a keep-the-idiot-occupied, sending them back and forth),
		only one of the two needs to be listed. The other can have "Hidden => 1," to hide it
		from the menu. This is also good for Easter Eggs commands! =)<p>

		<b>Restrict => 'Administrator',</b><br>
		This is to restrict the category this command appears in. It's a good idea to keep
		higher-level commands in their own categories, as a category that contains just ONE
		restricted command will not allow users to see it unless they qualify for that power.
		Valid powers are: Botmaster, Administrator, Moderator.
