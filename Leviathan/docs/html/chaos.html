<b class="header">:: Anatomy of $chaos</b><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	This is a basic overview of how the $chaos hashref is organized.<p>

<b class="header">:: Top-Level Key/Values</b><br>
<i>These keys are top-levels that contain a single value.</i><p>

<blockquote>
	<b>$chaos->{version}</b><br>
	Contains the current version number.<p>

	<b>$chaos->{author}</b><br>
	Contains the program author's name (Cerone Kirsle).<p>

	<b>$chaos->{debug}</b><br>
	Boolean flag; 1 will show debug messages (there's a lot of them).<p>

	<b>$chaos->{games}</b><br>
	Holds the Games::Manager object for multiplayer games.
</blockquote>

<b class="header">:: The System Key</b><br>
<i>These keys are for global systemic things.</i><p>

<blockquote>
	<b>$chaos->{system}->{restrict_listeners}</b><br>
	This key will equal 1 if you started Juggernaut with a "/aim /msn /irc" etc. flag to only
	sign on certain listeners.<p>

	<b>$chaos->{system}->{suppress}</b><br>
	Boolean flag; if 1, warnings will not be shown on console, but only printed to the log.
	This can be activated by putting the "/s" flag when starting the bot.<p>

	<b>$chaos->{system}->{maintain}->{on}</b><br>
	<b>$chaos->{system}->{maintain}->{msg}</b><br>
	Maintenance mode settings. <b>{on}</b> will be 1 for on, 0 for off. <b>{msg}</b> is the
	message that the bots will return on IM while maintenance mode is on.<p>

	<b>$chaos->{system}->{active_loops}</b><br>
	This should not be tampered with; the bot keeps track of how many times it loops in the
	&active sub (every so many loops it will log its activity time to a file).<p>

	<b>$chaos->{system}->{queue}</b><br>
	Used for queued events. Sub-keys are named after (usually) the bot's screenname that is
	using the key; although for non-bot-related events, sub-keys may be named after whatever
	that event identified itself as.<p>

	<b>$chaos->{system}->{signon}</b><br>
	The time() that the bot signed on.<p>

	<b>$chaos->{system}->{substitution}</b><br>
	Sub-keys are the search text of a substitution (i.e. "ISN'T"). Substitution sub-keys contain
	{replace} -- the text to replace it with -- and {level}, the replace level (0 = replace anywhere,
	1 = replace only if alone).<p>

	<b>$chaos->{system}->{commands}</b><br>
	Sub-keys are named after each command (minus the .PL extensions). Command sub-keys are
	the returned data from those commands.<p>

	<b>$chaos->{system}->{brains}</b><br>
	Sub-keys are named after the brains (minus the .PL extensions). Brain sub-keys are the
	returned data from those brains.<p>

	<b>$chaos->{system}->{handlers}</b><br>
	Sub-keys are named after each handler file (<i>including</i> the .PL extensions). Handler
	sub-keys are returned data from those handlers.<p>

	<b>$chaos->{system}->{subroutines}</b><br>
	Sub-keys are named after each subroutine file (<i>including</i> the .PL extensions).
	Subroutine sub-keys are returned data from those subroutines.
</blockquote>

<b class="header">:: The Data Key</b><br>
<i>These keys are global data for the bots to all share.</i><p>

<blockquote>
	<b>$chaos->{data}->{blocks}</b><br>
	Not used.<p>

	<b>$chaos->{data}->{substitutions}</b><br>
	Not used; moved to $chaos->{system}->{substitution}<p>

	<b>$chaos->{data}->{aim}->{chats}</b><br>
	General AIM chatroom settings. First-level keys are the name of the chat room, lowercased
	and without spaces. Sub-key contains the current room's "topic" - this is so multiple bots
	in the same room will have the same topic for that room.
</blockquote>

<b class="header">:: The Clients Key</b><br>
<i>These keys are for holding user data.</i><p>

<blockquote>
	<b>$chaos->{clients}</b><br>
	Sub-keys are the client's User ID (formatted as MESSENGER-username). Sub-keys of each
	user contain all the data as found in their profile (name, age, location, etc.)<p>

	<b>$chaos->{clients}->{*}->{callback}</b><br>
	Callbacks, usually used with commands. Their callback is inserted to the front of their
	message if they didn't trigger a command, and then a command is tried with the new
	callback. That's so commands (like !menu) can send you back to them without having to
	type !menu every time.<p>

	<b>$chaos->{clients}->{*}->{mute}</b><br>
	If mute-mode is on. This key will be 1 if they're muted; bots won't send replies to
	muted users.<p>

	<b>$chaos->{clients}->{*}->{cloak}</b><br>
	Cloaking mode. Only botmasters have access to the !cloak command for activating or
	deactivating cloaking mode. When cloaked, your conversation logs are not printed to
	the DOS console, nor are they logged to files.
</blockquote>

<b class="header">:: The Bots Key</b><br>
<i>These keys are for holding bot data.</i><p>

<blockquote>
	<b>$chaos->{bots}</b><br>
	Sub-keys would be the bot's username (i.e. name@domain.com for MSN, screenname for AIM,
	name@jabber.com for Jabber, etc.). Sub-keys for each bot would contain their data, as
	found in their bot file in the "bots" folder.<p>

	<b>$chaos->{bots}->{*}->{client}</b><br>
	This holds the bot's messenger object, and is used to execute top-level commands (only
	applies to MSN... the other messengers can simply use $self as received in the handlers).<p>

	<b>$chaos->{bots}->{*}->{_data}</b><br>
	Contains keys for your <i>bot's</i> personal profile data. Similar to client data.
