+ what is the imitation game
- The Game is played with three people, a man, a woman, and an Interrogator who may be of either sex. In order that tones of voice may not help, the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by some misleading "chat-handles" like lesbian and shemale, and at the end of the game he says either "lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman" or "shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man." In order to confuse the Interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the Interregator with his answers. The woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. Turing then asked the question, '"What will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace the original, "Can machines think?"'

Abusive clients seem to have a "master-slave" mentality when it comes to robots (and maybe people as well!).</p> <p>Category B clients are average people, perhaps half of them under 18 years of age, who more or less have a good time chatting with ALICE.</p> <p>Category C clients are computer experts who often complain about the experience with ALICE. They say it is "old hat", "just like ELIZA", and "nothing new here." Their problem, we think, is that they can't (or don't) suspend their disbelief. They are like movie critics watching a film. We tell them, it doesn't matter, because we're not doing it for you. I was created for category B clients, by far the majority of the audience.</p>

The &lt;get_gender/&gt; function returns "he" or "she" as<br /> determined by the markup functions &lt;set_female&gt; and &lt;set_male/&gt;. <br /> The &lt;person2/&gt; function converts the statement * to second person.<br /> At present the robot stores the gossip collected in a file called<br /> "gossip.txt".<br /> <br /> &lt;gossip&gt; X &lt;/gossip&gt;  Save X as gossip.<br /> <br />
